# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. We wrote a script
to pull the GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve the geographical coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. 
The data is then added to a map. Since the information is linked to a real-time source, the map will update whenever the user accesses it. Scripts are built using 
JavaScript and D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. We then used Leaflet library to plot the data 
on a Mapbox style map through an API request and made it interactive by adding visualization for different map styles, creating layers to display Tectonic 
plates, Earthquake magnitude and location information.
